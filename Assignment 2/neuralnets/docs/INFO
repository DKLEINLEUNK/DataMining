# 1. Feedforward Neural Networks
Feedforward Neural Networks, also known as Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs), are the simplest type of neural network used for classification problems.

### Structure
    Input layer: One node for each feature.
    One or more hidden layers with a number of neurons.
    Output layer: One node for binary classification (use sigmoid activation).

##### Pros
    Easy to implement.
    Can handle a large number of features and samples.
    Suitable for structured/tabular data.

##### Cons
    Might not capture complex relationships without deep architecture.
